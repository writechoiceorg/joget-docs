Joget offers standard components for generating complex applications, including user interfaces (UI), forms, lists, and processes. On this page you find basic description for each of these components. You will learn how to create and use them on the [Create an App](./create-an-app) page.

## UIs: Where functionality meets user experience

At the heart of every app lies the UI - the gateway through which users access its features. An app can comprise one or more UIs, each with its unique theme. These UIs consist of menu pages housing an array of elements, such as forms, lists, reports, graphs, and even HTML content. The UI is your canvas to deliver an outstanding user experience.

## Forms: Capturing information seamlessly

Forms are essential tools for collecting and presenting data. They come in various formats, from basic text fields to advanced form grids, making it easy to gather information efficiently. Our selection of form elements provides you with the appropriate tool for any task, whether it's a simple text entry or a complex data arrangement.

## Lists: Tabular insights

Lists are organized spreadsheets with superpowers that make data consumption delightful. These tables bring forth a wealth of features, including paging, sorting, filtering, and exporting. They transform raw data into meaningful insights while maintaining a structured appearance.

## Processes: Guiding workflow

When using Joget, a process is a series of steps that are connected and work together to achieve a specific goal or task within an application. Processes are essential in determining the flow of tasks, data, and interactions within the application. This can include tasks such as routing and working with external systems like sending emails or updating databases.
