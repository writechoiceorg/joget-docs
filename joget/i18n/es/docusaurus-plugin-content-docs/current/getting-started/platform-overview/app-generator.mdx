The App Generator feature made its debut in version 4. This powerful tool will help you streamline the creation of Joget Workflow apps, providing an agile approach for both rapid prototyping and comprehensive development, all while maintaining a user-centric perspective.

App Generator is perfect for boosting app development and smoothing early interactions with end-users. With its capabilities, you can automatically shape an app with lists, CRUD functionality (Create-Read-Update-Delete), a versatile approval process, and the sleek Twitter Bootstrap theme.

To generate a new app, you need to define its components first. Therefore, we suggest you to go thouth the [Create an app](./create-an-app) guide first.

## Using the App Generator

To understand the potential of the App Generator, we present a guide on how to create an app below quickly.

1. **Craft your form**: Create and design your form according to your requirements. Once you're satisfied, remember to save the form. If you are not familiar with creating forms, check the [Create an App](./create-an-app) guide.
2. **Initiate app generation**: Click on **Generate App** at the top right corner of the Form Builder.
3. **Navigate the App Generator dialog**: A dialogue box will appear providing several options of to configure your app covering your needs:

   - **Generate datalist**: For data display.
   - **Generate CRUD**: Enabling Create-Read-Update-Delete actions.
   - **Incorporate approval process**: Seamlessly integrating approval workflows.
   - **Incorporate assignment process**: Streamlining task assignments.
   - **Advanced generation**: Fine-tune options for a tailored output.

4. **Generate your app**: After setting the configurations, click **Generate**.
5. **Witness the transformation**: Refresh your App design page after the generation process concludes. Behold an array of auto-generated forms, lists, UI components, and processes will be available to you on the App Composer.
6. **Use your app**: The new app is automatically published. It will be available at the App Center, where you can launch it and start using.
