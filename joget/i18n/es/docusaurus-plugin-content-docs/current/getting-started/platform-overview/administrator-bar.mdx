The Administrator Bar, a feature initially introduced in Joget Workflow v4, offers administrators an efficient and user-friendly means of managing applications and users. In Joget DX 8, this functionality has been further refined to enhance its intuitiveness, particularly for touch-enabled devices.

## Accessing the Administrator Bar

To access the Administrator Bar, follow these simple steps:

1. Log into the App Center as an Administrator using the following credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin

A new tab displaying the App Center will open by clicking the Joget logo at the bottom left corner. On the other hand, clicking any other button will trigger an overlay seamlessly displayed over the existing window. Use the red **X** button at the top right corner to close the overlay.
