In the Joget ecosystem, you find various apps ranging from simple database-driven ones to more complex approval workflows and comprehensive solutions like Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Apps are web applications designed to run on the Joget platform. These apps seamlessly integrate workflow management, data administration, and robust reporting capabilities, empowering your digital transformation journey.

You have the freedom to personalize or craft your very own version of the App Center. Refer to the [Customizing App Center](https://dev.joget.org/community/display/DX8/Customizing+App+Center) guide for detailed information on customizing the App Center.

### Step 1 - Accessing the App Center

The App Center is the default landing page within Joget DX, showcasing a grid of published apps designed to enhance your efficiency and innovation. To access the App Center, use a web browser to navigate to your Joget server. Enter http://localhost:8080/jw, replacing "localhost" and "8080" with the appropriate server host and port if needed.

### Step 2 - Login

Navigate to the top right corner and select the **Login** link to access the platform as a user. Each user's experience is tailored, granting access to distinct apps based on individual permissions.

A set of sample logins is provided in a standard installation to help you enter the system quickly.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>User</th>
      <th>Login information</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Administrator</td>
      <td>
        Username: admin <br /> Password: Admin
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Normal user (Employee)</td>
      <td>
        Username: cat <br /> Password: password
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Normal user (Manager)</td>
      <td>
        Username: clark <br /> Password: password
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Step 3 - Find and initiate new apps

Click **All Apps** and use the search box to find desired applications quickly. For instance, type **claim** to spot the sample **HR Expenses Claim App instantly**.

Initiate any app effortlessly by clicking on the corresponding app box. This action will open the app in a new browser window, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Install Apps from Joget Marketplace

You can tap into the Joget Marketplace within the App Center's realm by selecting **Download from Marketplace**. Apps discovered within the Joget Marketplace can be effortlessly integrated into your Joget instance, expanding your toolkit.

:::info Access Joget Marketplace

To access the Joget Marketplace, you'll need to register for a separate Joget Marketplace account. Ensure you're logged into the Joget Marketplace from the App Center to be able to install apps.

2. Hover over any template to reveal the **Use The Template** and **More Info** options.

You can also use templates when designing new apps:
