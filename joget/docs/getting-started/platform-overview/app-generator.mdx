The App Generator feature made its debut in version 4. This powerful tool will help you streamline the creation of Joget Workflow apps, providing an agile approach for both rapid prototyping and comprehensive development, all while maintaining a user-centric perspective.

App Generator is perfect for boosting app development and smoothing early interactions with end-users. With its capabilities, you can automatically shape an app with lists, CRUD functionality (Create-Read-Update-Delete), a versatile approval process, and the sleek Twitter Bootstrap theme.

To generate a new app, you need to define its components first. Therefore, we suggest you to go thouth the [Create an app](./create-an-app) guide first. At the end you will use the App Generator feature to publish and have access to it throuth the App Center.

## Getting Started

To harness the potential of the App Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Craft your form**: Create and design your form according to your requirements. Once you're satisfied, remember to save the form.
2. **Initiate app generation**: Now, spot the prominent "Generate App" button perched at the top-right corner of the Form Builder.
3. **Navigate the App Generator dialog**: Upon clicking, a dialogue box will greet you, offering an array of options that cater to your needs:

   - **Generate datalist**: For data display.
   - **Generate CRUD**: Enabling Create-Read-Update-Delete actions.
   - **Incorporate approval process**: Seamlessly integrating approval workflows.
   - **Incorporate assignment process**: Streamlining task assignments.
   - **Advanced generation**: Fine-tune options for a tailored output.

4. **Optimize your app**: After setting the configurations, tap the "Generate" button and watch the magic unfold.
5. **Witness the transformation**: Refresh your App design page after the generation process concludes. Behold an array of auto-generated forms, lists, UI components, and processes, all taking shape without the sweat.
6. **App center arrival**: Your newly minted app is automatically published and primed for action. Accessible from the App Center, it's now at your fingertips, ready to dazzle and streamline.
