Joget offers standard components for generating complex applications, including user interfaces (UI), forms, lists, and processes. You will learn more about these essential components on this page.

## UIs: Where functionality meets user experience

At the heart of every app lies the UI - the gateway through which users access its features. An app can comprise one or more UIs, each with its unique theme. These UIs consist of menu pages housing an array of elements, such as forms, lists, reports, graphs, and even HTML content. The UI is your canvas to deliver an outstanding user experience.

## Forms: Capturing information seamlessly

Forms are the versatile workhorses of data collection and presentation. From basic text fields to sophisticated form grids, they allow you to capture and showcase information efficiently. Our range of form elements ensures you have the right tool for every job, whether a simple text entry or a complex data arrangement.

_Try it out yourself: In the sample Expenses Claim App, step into the shoes of a regular employee (Clark). Navigate to the New Expenses Claim section after logging in. Here, you'll encounter an expenses claim form. Just fill in the details, hit Complete, and watch your submission take flight._

## Lists: Tabular insights

Lists are organized spreadsheets with superpowers that make data consumption delightful. These tables bring forth a wealth of features, including paging, sorting, filtering, and exporting. They transform raw data into meaningful insights while maintaining a structured appearance.

_Take a leap: Now, imagine being in the shoes of Cat's manager, Clark. After logging in, click on Approver Inbox in the menu. Here, you'll find a datalist that reveals your task inbox. Look closely, and you'll spot a pending claim from Cat. The process is in motion, and you're at the helm._

## Processes: Guiding workflow

Processes in the app world ensure seamless task flow, like a well-choreographed dance. This could involve routing tasks and integrating with external systems, such as sending emails or updating databases.

\_Ready to make decisions: Assume the role of Clark once again. Click on the "Approve Claim" link, and you'll be granted a window into Cat's submission. You have the power to give it the green light.

Different Strokes: The HR Expenses Claim App embodies process-driven efficiency. But for a change of pace, journey to the App Center and launch the Simple CRM. This app takes a pragmatic approach to data management, focusing on essentials like accounts, contacts, opportunities, and cases.\_
