The Administrator Bar, a feature initially introduced in Joget Workflow v4, offers administrators an efficient and user-friendly means of managing applications and users. In Joget DX 8, this functionality has been further refined to enhance its intuitiveness, particularly for touch-enabled devices.

## Getting Started

To access the Administrator Bar, follow these simple steps:

**(Add a video here showing the steps)**

1. **Log into the App Center as an Administrator**: In a standard installation, the default administrator credentials are as follows:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin
2. Locate the Admin Bar icon: You can access the Admin Bar by tapping on the pencil icon located at the bottom right corner.
3. **Exploring the features**: The Admin Bar provides you with a gateway to a comprehensive set of features.

While using the Admin Bar, remember that by clicking the Joget logo at the bottom left corner will swiftly return you to the App Center. On the other hand, by clicking any other button will trigger an overlay, seamlessly displayed over the existing window. To close the overlay, simply click the red **X** button positioned at the top right corner.

Use the **All Apps** to unveil an overlay showcasing both published and unpublished applications. You'll also find options to craft a new application or import apps from external sources.
