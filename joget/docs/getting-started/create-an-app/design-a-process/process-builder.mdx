- **Step 5**: You can access components to integrate into the process on the left menu. Drag and drop them to the central area to include new elements in your process. In the example below, a second **Participant** was added.

- **Step 6**: Select and update the Participants' data. When you select a component of your process, a new panel appears on the right, where you can configure the component's data and operation. The participants' labels were modified to **Register** and **Approver** in the example.
