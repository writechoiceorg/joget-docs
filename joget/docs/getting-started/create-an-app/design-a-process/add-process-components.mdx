Now that you know the Process Builder interface, we can structure the Travel Request process.

The Travel Request process is composed of two **Participants**. One refers to all users who will register the travel request. The second participant relates to the user who will approve or deny the request. After the approval or denial, the system will automatically send an email informing the decision regarding the travel request.

To create this process, you will follow the steps below. Be sure to have finished all previous steps before continuing.

- **Step 1**: Add an **Activity** to the **Register** participant and connect the **Start** to it. Change the new activity label to **Submit Request**.

- **Step 2**: Move a new **Activity** to the **Approver** participant and connect the **Submit Request** to it. Change its label to **Approve Request**.

- **Step 3**: Integrate a route to the **Approver** participant and connect the **Approve Request** to it. The route will evaluate if the request status is approved and define the next process step.

- **Step 4**: Add two new tolls to the **Approver** participant and connect the route to them. Rename them as **Send Approved Email** and **Send Rejected Email**. Add and then connect each tool component to an end component.

Currently, we have established the process structure, but we still need to configure each step. To do so, we must associate components with forms and define functioning rules. Access the [Configure Components](./configure-components) page to continue the tutorial.
