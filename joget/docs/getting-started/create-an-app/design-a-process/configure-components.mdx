After defining the process structure, it's time to map each component. The mapping process refers to connecting a process component to a form, list, user group, etc. All components added to the process need to be configured. Otherwise, the process will not work.

## Mapping participants to users

Each existing participant needs to be associated with one user type.

- **Step 1**: Click on any Participant and select **Configure Mapping** on the right panel.
- **Step 2**: Select the user type. Then, click **Apply Changes**.

## Mapping Activities to forms

Activities are related to actions users need to perform. Therefore, when you add a new activity to the process, you need to define which action it will associate with.

- **Step 1**: Select the activity. For this example, select the Submit Request.
- **Step 2**: On the right panel, select Mapping.
- **Step 3**: For **Type**, choose **Form**, and then select the **Travel Request Form**. Then, click **Apply Changes**.

## Mapping Tools to Plugins

Tools execute predefined actions automatically when a condition is triggered. In this case, tools automatically notify the requester about the travel approval or denials. To make the tool perform the action, we need to map it to a plugin, in this case, the **Email** plugin.

- **Step 1**: Select the desired tool within the process.
- **Step 2**: On the right panel, select **Mapping** and for the **Tools**, choose **Email**.
- **Step 3**: Configure the action. In this case, we would add all information for the communication Email. Then, click **Apply Changes**.
