After defining the process structure, it's time to map each component. The mapping process refers to connecting a process component to a form, list, user group, etc. All components added to the process need to be configured. Otherwise, the process will not work.

## Mapping participants to users

Each existing participant needs to be associated with one user type.

- **Step 1**: Click on a **Participant**. For this example, select the **Register** one.

/>

- **Step 2**: Select **Configure Mapping** on the right panel.

  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 3**: Choose the group or specific users to be mapped to the Participant. For this case, the Participant is mapped to Type **Department**, where we selected the **Product Development** **Department**. Click **Apply Changes** to finish mapping.

:::info Restrict access by mapping Participants
When you map a Participant to a user group, only they will have access to the actions related to that portion of the process. In the above example, only the Product Development department users would have access to the **Submit Request** form.

## Mapping Activities to forms

Activities are related to actions users need to perform. Therefore, when you add a new activity to the process, you need to define which action it will associate with. The Travel Request app has two activities in its process. They are described individually to make it easier for you to understand.

### Submit Request

The form related to the travel request was created in the previous steps. Consequently, you only need to map the Activity to the request, as described in the steps below.

- **Step 1**: Select the **Activity**. For this example, select the **Submit Request**.

<Images

  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 2**: On the right panel, select **Mapping** and for **Type**, choose **Form**, and then select the **Travel Request Form**. Click **Apply Changes**.

  wSize="65%"
/>

### Approve Request

The approval form was not created on the previous steps. We will create the approval form from the Process Builder page to show the flexibility provided by Joget. Follow the steps below to map the Approve Request activity to the new form.

- **Step 1**: Select the **Approve Request** **Activity**.
- **Step 2**: On the right panel, select **Mapping** and for **Type**, choose **Form**. Instead of selecting a form, Click on **+** button to create the Travel Approval Form.

<Images
  imgURL="img/getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-process/configure-component-activity-form-1.png"
  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 3**: Fill the form creation fields with the following information and then click **Save** to create the form.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Value for this example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Form ID</td>
      <td>A unique identifier.</td>
      <td>travelApprovalForm</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Form Name</td>
      <td>A unique descriptive name.</td>
      <td>Travel Approval Form</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Table Name</td>
      <td>The database table name to store the form data.</td>
      <td>travel_requests</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- **Step 4**: Select the **Travel Approval Form**. Then, to start building the form, click on **OPEN ITEM IN BUILDER**. You will be redirected to the Form Builder page.

<Images

  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 5**: To start building the new form, first let's add a **Subform**. It will be used to present the request information. Drag and drop the subform into the form.

<Images
  imgURL="img/getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-process/configure-component-activity-form-4.png"
  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 6**: Select the subform to configure it. Define its **Label** as **Request**, its **ID** as **request**, and choose **Travel Request Form** on the **Form** field. As a result, the subform will present the information provided when creating the request, enabling the decision maker to approve or deny the request. Click **Apply Change**.

<Images
  imgURL="img/getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-process/configure-component-activity-form-5.png"
  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 7**: Add a Radio button to the form, below the subform. The radio button will provide the approve and deny options.

<Images
  imgURL="img/getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-process/configure-component-activity-form-6.png"
  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 8**: Click on the radio button to configure its properties. The necessary configurations are listed below:

  - Define Label as **Approval**.
  - Define ID as **approval**.
  - Check the **Display Option Vertically** box.
  - Under **Options** click on **+ Add** to add the Approved and Rejected options.
    - For the first option, define its Value and Label as **Approved**.
    - For the second option, define its Value and Label as **Rejected**.
  - Click on **Advanced Options** and for the **Workflow Variable** enter **status**.
  - Click **Apply Change**.

/>

:::info Workflow Variables
Workflow variables are used to determine operations in the process. By associating a workflow variable to the radio button, we ensure the variable will receive the selected value, which other components will use to determine the process behavior. For this example, the variable can receive the values Approved or Rejected, which will define whether the requester will receive approval for their travel request.
:::

- **Step 9**: You've built the new form, which should look like the image below. Click on **Save** in the top right corner. Then, return to the process builder tab.

<Images

/>

- **Step 10**: Click **Apply Change** on the process builder tab to finish the **Approve Request** activity.

## Mapping Routes to Plugins

Routes define the process flow when a process intersection exists. Routes determine the next step of a process based on workflow variables or other attributes. Follow the steps to configure the existing route in the Travel Request process.

- **Step 1**: Select the **Route** within the process. Then select **Mapping** on the right panel and for **Plugin** choose **Simple Rules**. Thus, we can define a rule to process the **status** workflow variable provided by the Approve Request.

<Images
  imgURL="img/getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-process/configure-component-route-1.png"
  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 2**: Define the rule to evaluate the workflow variable. Below you find all rule configurations and an image with the final configurations.

  - Click **+ Add Rule** to access the rule configuration.
  - In the **IF** rule, click **+ Add Condition**.
  - Set the **Variable** field to **status** and set the **Value** field to **Approved**.
  - In the **THEN** rule, click on **+ Add Action** and set **Type** to **Transition**.
  - Set **Transition** to **transition5 (Send Approved Email)**, meaning that this transition will happen when **status** is **Approved**.
  - In the **ELSE THEN** rule, set the **Type** to **Transition**.
  - Set **Transition** to **transition6 (Send Rejected Email)**, meaning that this transition will happen when **status** is **Rejected**.

  wSize="55%"
/>

- **Step 3**: Click **Apply Change**.

## Mapping Tools to Plugins

Tools execute predefined actions automatically when a condition is triggered. In this case, tools automatically notify the requester about the travel approval or denials. To make the tool perform the action, we need to map it to a plugin, in this case, the **Email** plugin.

- **Step 1**: Select the desired **Tool** within the process.

<Images
  imgURL="img/getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-process/configure-component-tool-1.png"
  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 2**: On the right panel, select **Mapping** and for the **Tools**, choose **Email**.

<Images
  imgURL="img/getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-process/configure-component-tool-2.png"
  wSize="65%"
/>

- **Step 3**: Configure the action. In this case, we would add all information for the communication Email. Then, click **Apply Changes**.

Each plugin will require different information to operate properly.

## Test the Process

On the Process Builder page you can test the created process by running it. To run the process, use the **Run Process** button at the top right corner.

Congratulations, you have mapped all components within the process. Now, you can [integrate the process into the UI](./integrate-process-into-ui).
