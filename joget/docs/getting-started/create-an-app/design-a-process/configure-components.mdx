After defining the process structure, it's time to map each component. The mapping process refers to connecting a process component to a form, list, user group, etc. All components added to the process need to be configured. Otherwise, the process will not work.

## Mapping participants to users

Each existing participant needs to be associated with one user type.

- **Step 1**: Click on a Participant. For this example, select the **Register** one.

  wSize="75%"
/>

- **Step 2**: Select **Configure Mapping** on the right panel.

  wSize="75%"
/>

- **Step 3**: Choose the group or specific users to be mapped to the Participant. For this case, the Participant is mapped to _Type_ **Departament**, where we selected the **Training and Consult** **Departament**. Click **Apply Changes** to finish mapping.

:::info Restrict acess by mapping Participants
When you map a Participant to a user group, only them will have access to the actions related to that portion of the process. In the above example, only users from the Training and Consult departament would have access to the **Submit Request** form.

## Mapping Activities to forms

Activities are related to actions users need to perform. Therefore, when you add a new activity to the process, you need to define which action it will associate with.

- **Step 1**: Select the activity. For this example, select the **Submit Request**.

  wSize="75%"
/>

- **Step 2**: On the right panel, select Mapping and for **Type**, choose **Form**, and then select the **Travel Request Form**. Click **Apply Changes**.

## Mapping Tools to Plugins

Tools execute predefined actions automatically when a condition is triggered. In this case, tools automatically notify the requester about the travel approval or denials. To make the tool perform the action, we need to map it to a plugin, in this case, the **Email** plugin.

- **Step 1**: Select the desired tool within the process.

  wSize="75%"
/>

- **Step 2**: On the right panel, select **Mapping** and for the **Tools**, choose **Email**.

<Images

  wSize="75%"

- **Step 3**: Configure the action. In this case, we would add all information for the communication Email. Then, click **Apply Changes**.
