It's time to create a list after creating the app and the form. You will use lists to display data to users. In this case, the list will show the data from the Travel Request form. Follow the steps on this page to create your first list.

- **Step 1**: Access the **App Composer** page.
- **Step 2**: Create a new List using the **+** button on the **List Builder** column.
- **Step 3**: Now, you will enter the List details, including:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Value for this example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>ID</td>
      <td>A unique identifier.</td>
      <td>requestList</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>A unique descriptive name.</td>
      <td>Travel Request List</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Describes the list's purpose.</td>
      <td>List to present the data acquired by the Travel Request form.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

- **Step 4**: Click **Save** to create the List. As a result, the **List Builder** will be launched.

- **Step 6**: Choose a Form. For this example, select the **Travel Request Form**.
- **Step 7**: Design your **List**. First, click on **Design** button at the top of the page. All available columns from the data source are listed on the left. Drag and drop the desired columns to design your List. For this example, drag and drop the following columns:

  - Name
