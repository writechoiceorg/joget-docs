The first step to creating a new app with Joget is to design it. Follow the steps on this page to design your first app.

- **Step 1**: To start, access the Joget App Center.
- **Step 2**: Log in as Administrator using the default administrator credentials.
- **Step 3**: Locate the **Admin Bar** at the bottom and click on **All Apps**.
- **Step 4**: To start designing a new app, after accessing the All Apps windows, use the **Design a New App** button.
- **Step 5**: Define the new app details, providing:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>App ID</td>
      <td>A unique identifier.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>App Name </td>
      <td>A unique descriptive name.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For this example, use App ID as **travelRequest**, and App Name as **Travel Request**

- **Step 6**: Click Save to create your app. You will be directed to the app design page.

Congratulations on designing a new app. Your next step is to [design a new form](./getting-started/create-an-app/design-a-form).
