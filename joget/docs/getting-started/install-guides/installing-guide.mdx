### Step 2 - Installing

- Execute the dowloaded file from Step 1.

### Step 3 - First starting Joget

- Open the **destination folder** you selected in installation.
- Find the **Start Joget Server** shortcut, and double click it. Here our program will open two instances of your systems terminal, one for MariaDB and the second to run Joget.
